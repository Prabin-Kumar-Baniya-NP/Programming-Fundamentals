# Basics of System Design

- System Design is the process of defining architecture, components, modules, interfaces and data for system to satisfy the requirements.

## Software Development Life Cycle

1. Planning / Requirement Gathering
2. Feasibility Study
3. System Design
4. Implementation
5. Testing
6. Deployment
7. Maintenance and Support

## Functional and Non Functional Requirement

- Functional requirement describes what the system should do â€” the specific behavior or functions of the system.
- Non-functional requirements describe how the system performs, or the quality attributes of the system.

```
1. Functional Requirements:
Users should be able to log in with their username and password.
Users should be able to check their account balance.
Users should receive notifications after making a transaction.

2. Non-functional Requirements:
The system should respond to user actions in less than 2 seconds.
All transactions must be encrypted and comply with industry security standards.
The system should be able to handle 100 million users with minimal downtime.
